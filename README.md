# Movie Project

This is a movie database project, where it shows movies, their casts, ratings, trailers, related movies, genres, and so on.

This project uses The Movie DB API: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3`. It is up to
you to use your Google and Postman skills to explore the API and understand the
data.

### What to do in class

- Add a Spinner component to the Navbar component and make it invisible by default also pass a function called `onSearch` to the SearchBox and then when you type some text inside the SearchBox component, call it to make the spinner in the Navbar component appears. You can use spinners from here https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/spinners/

- use this function to fetch and donâ€™t change it, the `path` is basically whatever your are requesting after the `TMDB_BASE_URL` like `/movies/popular`

```jsx
const constructUrl = (path, query) => {
  return `${TMDB_BASE_URL}/${path}?api_key=${atob(
    "ZDJmYTdhZDFlMjZhZjA4NDdkMzQ5ZDdkYmQ1ZjkzZTU="
  )}&query=${query}`;
};
```

- checkout this for more info about the search api endpoint
  https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies

- Implement the SearchBox component to search for the input using the `constructUrl` function passing it the search path and query, and then return the results into the main component using a handler function. the function should be passed as a prop to the SearchBox.
- Send the movies response from the main component to another component that will render the movies and lets call it MoviesGrid.
- In the MoviesGrid map each movie to another component called MovieItem.

### Homework

- Go to the TMDB documentations and see how you can get all the genres (the categories) and how to get popular movies in this category
- Fetch the categories and put them inside a dropdown inside the NavBar
- when you change categories from the dropdown it should fetch the popular movies in that category

### Styling

feel free to style the movies list but we suggest making it as a grid and each movie has the poster and title under it, maybe call effect when hovering or something or hide the title and show it when hovering, don't know be creative with it
